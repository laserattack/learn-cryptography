# Wtf?

Implementations of various cryptographic algorithms in the form of self-contained headers in C

## Ciphers

- [x] Simple SP Network
- [x] Feistel network with SP-round function
- [x] DES
- [ ] 3DES
- [ ] AES

# Usage

All implementations are single-header libraries. Usage examples can be found in `test.c`.

Running tests: `make && ./test.out`
